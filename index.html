        The text wears its origins on its sleeve. Initially, I edited out each
        chapter's little introductory line, intended to reorient the daily
        reader to the action; reading it straight through, they're repetitive, a
        bit "duh." But then I discovered that I missed them: their dorky energy;
        the breathless, retro sense of "last week on <em>Annabel Scheme</em>!"

        Every day, Stella Pajunas caught her lunch on the sidewalk in front of
        Alta Bay City Development headquarters. As the chief executive of the
        ABCD, she didn’t have to catch it herself; she could have sent an
        underling scurrying to the sidewalk. But Stella Pajunas was smart. Her
        daily appearance marked her as a woman of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a sunny Tuesday in June, Stella Pajunas missed her burrito. This
        wouldn’t have been a problem except that multiple pedestrian onlookers
        watched her step onto the sidewalk, reach upward, and vanish. Burrito,
        splat.
      </p>
      <p>Dramatic enough way for a mystery to begin.</p>
      <p>
        My name is Will Portacio. I have been an archivist, a librarian and a
        Lyft driver. Until recently, I was the assistant to the Bay Area’s
        greatest detective. I’m publishing this now because of what happened to
        Stella Pajunas and the detective and all of us.

        Annabel Scheme kept an office in Rotten City. The locals love to call it
        that, insisting endlessly on their neighborhood’s sinister character; in
        fact, it’s utterly sweet, a mix of old houses and new condos, espresso
        bars and metalworking shops, all of it softened by trees, plum and palm
        and ginkgo. Scheme’s office occupied the top floor of a narrow brick
        building that also housed a rare book dealer, a biotech consultancy and
        a website that reviewed electric bicycles. On the ground floor, there
        was a jam factory. I couldn’t quite see the railroad tracks from my
        desk, but when the high-speed to Fresno shot past, it made a little
        sonic boom that rattled the windows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scheme had conducted investigations for the City of San Francisco and
        the Port of Oakland; for Google and Dragoman; for Chevron and Chez
        Panisse. Her specialty was the anomalous, the irrational. When something
        seemed like it must be a ghost, but surely it wasn’t, you called Annabel
        Scheme. It was only ever sometimes a ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ABCD itself was a steady client, thanks to its security chief, whose
        name was Arbusto Slab. It was Slab who stood now in Scheme’s office,
        perfectly quadrilateral, wide shouldered and wide hipped. It was Slab
        who had just described to us the strange fate of his boss.
      </p>
      <p>He squinted at me, jabbed a finger. “Who’s the nerd?”</p>
      <p>
        “I am the nerd,” Scheme replied coolly. “My very hip partner is a
        renowned analyst of the digital and the occult.”
      </p>
      <p>
        No one truly hip has ever been called hip, but I appreciated the
        gesture. Arbusto Slab gazed at me and whatever evaluation he made, he
        mentally crumpled it up and threw it in a wastebasket. He looked back at
        Scheme. and, I suspect , never thought of me again.
      </p>

        “Well, anyway, she’s been gone a whole day now, or near enough, and the
        board of directors… they are not calm people, Scheme. Not calm at all.
        It’s a big operation, the ABCD. I really think—”
      </p>
      <p>“I’ll take the case,” Scheme said. “We’ll meet you on the bay.”</p>
      <p>
        Scheme’s electric pickup was parked across the street. The jam factory
        was simmering 300 pounds of seascape strawberries; the air was thick
        with them. One of the website’s editors was pedaling a cargo bike up and
        down the block. Rotten City.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scheme took us blasting south on Interstate 1080, windows down, her red
        curls whipping in the wind. The big cities of the bay flashed by on
        either side: busy Moletown, glittering San Leandro, Asparagus Flats with
        its high-rise greenhouses.
      </p>
      <p>I wondered if Scheme had worked up any theories.</p>
      <p>
        “Sure. Most likely explanation is, Stella Pajunas was never real to
        start with. Ectoplasmic projection. Mass hallucination, maybe.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Scheme was theorizing that the ABCD — really, the whole Bay Area — had
        been managed for 10 years by a mass hallucination?
      </p>
      <h3>
        Definition
      </h3>
      <p>“It would explain some things, wouldn’t it?”</p>
      <p>
        We crossed into the sprawl of Peralta City. On the other side of 1080
        was the Island of the Cats, which was neither an island nor home to any
        special concentration of cats.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scheme was still theorizing. “It matters how she disappeared. If there
        was a flash of light, that’s one thing. Smell of brimstone, totally
        different thing. I hope she didn’t just vanish between frames.”
      </p>
      <p>Between frames?</p>
      <p>
        “Here one millisecond, gone the next. The best explanation for that kind
        of phenomenon is that we’re living in a computer simulation, and I am
        going to be PISSED if we’re living in a computer simulation.”
      </p>
      <p>Scheme’s phone rang, warbling the theme to “Vertigo.”</p>
      <p>“Slab,” she said into the air. “We’re on our way.”</p>
      <p>
        The security chief’s voice rumbled in the pickup’s speakers. “Yeah,
        well. She’s back.”
      </p>
      <p>“Pajunas? The one who disappeared?”</p>
      <p>
        “Yeah, and she’s screaming a lot.” In the background, we heard a shriek.
      </p>
      <h3>

      <p>
        “Stuff about the bay. How they didn’t fill it. I don’t know. What did
        she just say, Lucy?” A voice replied. “Okay, yeah. She just said, it was
        all a mistake and now – yeah, she’s crying. Anyway. I still think you
        should come.” Dramatic enough way for a mystery to begin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scheme pushed the pickup even faster, the whole boiling megacity of the
        bay a blur on either side of us, and I wondered where Stella Pajunas had
        been for the last twenty-four hours. What she’d seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Call in some burritos, will you?” Scheme said. “We’ll catch them when
        we get there.”
      </p>
